                            The suggested actions and clinical comments are based on available information sources such as the Australian Product Information, available at the <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/product-information-0">Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods Website</a>, the <a href="https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/checker">Liverpool COVID-19 Interactions Checker</a>, the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mr43wunt">Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table</a> and the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2k7nba9p" target="_blank">NIH Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and the Concomitant Medication </a>. For some medicines, data on nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir interaction is limited.
</p>
                        <p>
                            Contraindicated - Consider alternative COVID-19 treatment. For these medicines, there is a risk of serious side effects or reduced treatment efficacy, and withholding medicines is not an effective or feasible strategy
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cease temporarily - Withhold medicine. For these medicines, there is a risk of serious adverse events. Only start nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir if the medicine can be safely stopped. The medicine can be resumed 3 days after treatment completion. They may need to be withheld for longer if the patient is elderly or the medication has a long half-life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reduce dose - If medicine cannot be safely stopped or replaced, adjust the dose and monitor for potential side effects. Information about individual dosing can be found at the Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions website
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Monitor - Dose adjustment is not required, but may be considered. Educate your patient about potential side effects and advise to stop this medicine if needed.
